# Restaurant Ordering App

This project is a web application for a restaurant that allows customers to view the restaurant's menu and place orders. Customers can add items to their basket, remove items, and view the total cost of their order.

## Usage
When the app is opened, the user is presented with a list of menu items. To add an item to the basket, click the "+" button next to the item. To remove an item from the basket, click the "remove" button next to the item in the basket. To view the total cost of the order, click the "place order" button. This will display a modal window where the user can enter their name and submit the order.
